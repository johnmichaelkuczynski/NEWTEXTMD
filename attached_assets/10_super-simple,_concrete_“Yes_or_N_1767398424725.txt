Free Speech: A Crash Course 

What Is Free Speech?
- Free speech = the right to say what you think without the government punishing you
- In the USA, it comes from the First Amendment: “Congress shall make no law… abridging the freedom of speech”
- It protects you from the GOVERNMENT, not from private companies, bosses, or schools kicking you out or firing you
- Most other countries have some version of free speech, but usually with more limits than the US

Is Hate Speech Free Speech?
- In the United States: YES, almost all hate speech is legally protected
- You can say racist, sexist, homophobic, anti-religious things and the government cannot arrest you for the words alone
- The Supreme Court says even speech we hate or that makes us really angry is protected (examples: Nazis marching in Skokie, burning the American flag, Westboro Baptist “God hates f-gs” signs at funerals — all protected)

Real Exceptions to Free Speech (the very few times government CAN punish you)
- True threats (“I’m going to kill you tomorrow at 3pm”)
- Fighting words (face-to-face insults so bad they make the average person immediately punch you — very rare now)
- Incitement (telling a crowd “Go burn that building right now!” when they’re ready to do it)
- Defamation (lying about someone that ruins their reputation — harder for famous people to win)
- Obscenity (hard-core porn with no artistic value — almost never punished anymore)
- Child pornography
- That’s pretty much it — everything else is protected, even if it’s awful

Does “Hurting Someone’s Feelings” Count as Hate Speech and Lose Protection?
- No. Hurt feelings are NEVER a legal reason to punish speech in the US
- Calling someone a name, misgendering them, saying “your religion is stupid,” saying “illegal immigrants are criminals” — all protected
- You might get fired, kicked off social media, or people might hate you, but the police can’t arrest you for it
- “I feel unsafe” or “that makes me feel attacked” does NOT remove someone’s free-speech rights

Hidden Limits on Free Speech That Most People Don’t Notice
- Private companies can censor you (Twitter/X, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, your job, your university)
- “Hate speech” rules on campus or at work are NOT government rules — they’re private rules
- “Time, place, and manner” rules (you can’t scream through a bullhorn at 3 a.m. in a neighborhood)
- You can be sued for telling provable lies that seriously damage someone (defamation)
- Government can’t stop you BEFORE you speak (that’s “prior restraint”) but can punish you after in the rare cases above
- Many people think “free speech” means “freedom from criticism” or “everyone has to listen” — it doesn’t

Quick Summary Slide She Can End With
- Free speech protects almost everything, even stuff that hurts feelings
- The only real exceptions are threats, incitement, defamation, and a couple others
- Hurt feelings do NOT cancel free speech
- Companies and schools can punish you even when the government can’t
- Free speech = shield from the government, not a shield from consequences in normal life
